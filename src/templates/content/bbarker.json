Currently there are two algorithms – Quad-Tree and Spatial Hashing – that are often used and at times it is based on personal preference. Spatial Hashing is a “bucket” based system where an objects relative area is increased and then inserted into surrounded buckets to be queried against. Quad-Trees are a recursive data structure that divide into quadrants as an object capacity is hit and a bounding box is identified for the selection of a quadrants."

With an intelligent turning system, Elderlyf gently helps with turning corners and avoiding obstacles.\n\nWith a Jetson Nano and RealSense Cameras, front view obstacles are detected and a map of the possible routes are generated. SLAM localization was also achieved using those technologies. By using two servo motors that could independently apply a gentle brake to the wheels to aid users when turning and avoiding obstacles. Piezoelectric vibrating disks were also used to provide haptic feedback in which direction to turn and when obstacles are close."

Currently, an unmet need exists at West Chester University (WCU) for student parents, increasing the challenges of the already intense college process. Traditional daycare centers can cost on average $972 a month for toddlers and do not allow parents to pick and choose days of use. Using local West Chester babysitters allows for flexibility in being able to utilize the service only when needed. The app will function specifically for the West Chester University community as participants will be required to enroll with a WCU ID number."

To bridge the gap between these two services, Entwine converts binary files into the 3D Tile format while supporting more Cesium-centric features. The tiles are optimized to reduce overhead in the browser through octree culling.  Other functionality includes: data quantization, metadata instancing, and property association."
