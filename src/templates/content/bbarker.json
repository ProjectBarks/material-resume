Currently, there are two algorithms—Quad-Tree and Spatial Hashing—which are often used, and at times, it is based on personal preference. Spatial Hashing is a “bucket” based system where an object’s relative area is increased and then inserted into surrounding buckets to be queried. Quad-Trees are a recursive data structure that divides into quadrants as an object capacity is hit and a bounding box is identified for the selection of a quadrant."

With vibration disks, strategically located underneath the hand rests, Elderlyf gives you haptic feedback to let you know when objects are in your way and in which direction you should turn. With an intelligent turning system, Elderlyf gently helps with turning corners and avoiding obstacles. With a Jetson Nano and RealSense Cameras, front view obstacles are detected, and a map of the possible routes is generated. SLAM localization was also achieved through those technologies by using two servo motors that could independently apply a gentle brake to the wheels to aid users when turning and avoiding obstacles. Piezoelectric vibrating disks were also used to provide haptic feedback on which direction to turn and when obstacles are close."

Meanwhile, Cesium is a JavaScript library for creating 3D globes in a web browser. To bridge the gap between these two services, Entium converts binary files into the 3D Tile format while supporting more Cesium-centric features. The tiles are optimized to reduce overhead in the browser through octree culling. Other functionality includes data quantization, metadata instancing, and property association."
