Currently there are two algorithms – Quad-Tree and Spatial Hashing – that are often used and at times it is based on personal preference. Spatial Hashing is a “bucket” based system where an objects relative area is increased and then inserted into surrounded buckets to be queried against. Quad-Trees are a recursive data structure that divide into quadrants as an object capacity is hit and a bounding box is identified for the selection of a quadrants."

The application then activates the Lego Mindstorms through a Bluetooth connection. Currently, the hand only has two groups of movable fingers and the thumb; however, in newer versions of the prosthetic more hydraulic arms could be added. The project was recognized by multiple fairs and has a broad range of applications."
